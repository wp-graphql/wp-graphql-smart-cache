=== Description ===

Do you want your API data _fast_ or _accurate_? With WPGraphQL Smart Cache, you can have both.

WPGraphQL Smart Cache is a free, open-source WordPress plugin that provides support for caching and cache invalidation of WPGraphQL Queries.

To get the most out of this plugin, we recommend using GET requests with Network Caching, which requires your WordPress install to be on a [supported host](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-smart-cache/blob/main/docs/network-cache.md#supported-hosts).

*BREAKING CHANGES:* We may make breaking changes in the future to improve functionality and experience. If we do, we will use semver to do so. Pay attention to release notes and upgrade notices before updating.

= Upgrading =

It is recommended that anytime you want to update WPGraphQL Smart Cache that you get familiar with what's changed in the release.

WPGraphQL Smart Cache publishes [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-smart-cache/releases).

WPGraphQL Smart Cache will follow Semver versioning.

The summary of Semver versioning is as follows:

- *MAJOR* version when you make incompatible API changes,
- *MINOR* version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- *PATCH* version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

You can read more about the details of Semver at [semver.org](https://semver.org)

== Privacy Policy ==

WPGraphQL Smart Cache uses [Appsero](https://appsero.com) SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user's confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

Appsero SDK **does not gather any data by default.** The SDK only starts gathering basic telemetry data **when a user allows it via the admin notice**. We collect the data to ensure a great user experience for all our users.

Integrating Appsero SDK **DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY** start gathering data, **without confirmation from users in any case.**

Learn more about how [Appsero collects and uses this data](https://appsero.com/privacy-policy/).


== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.3.0 =

This fixes a regression to WPGraphQL v1.20.0 where the Query Analyzer became optional and defaulted to "off". WPGraphQL Smart Cache force-enables the Query Analyzer to support Cache tagging and tag-based cache invalidation.

= 1.2.0 =

**Code Removal**
This release removes some code specific to WP Engine that's been moved to WP Engine's MU Plugins.

Updating to WPGraphQL Smart Cache v1.2.0 or newer should be done at the same time as updating to [WPGraphQL v1.16.0](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases)
otherwise some caches might not evict properly in response to data changes.

**Garbage Collection of GraphQL Document**
When using "Automated Persisted Queries", documents are stored in the "GraphQL Document" post type and as client queries change over time an excess of persisted queries can be stored.

Garbage collection allows for documents to be purged after a certain amount of time.

You can enable "Garbage Collection" under "GraphQL > Settings > Saved Queries" and checking the option to "Delete Old Queries".

When enabling this feature, documents that are not associated with a "Group" will be purged after xx amount of days according to the settings.

Before enabling this setting, we recommend going through your saved GraphQL Documents and assigning a "group" to any that you want to skip garbage collection.

Groups are like bookmarks or collections for your GraphQL Documents. You can use them for whatever reason you like, but if a document is grouped, it will not be automatically garbage collected.

= 0.2.0 =

This release removes a lot of code that has since been released as part of WPGraphQL core.

In order to use v0.2.0+ of WPGraphQL Smart Cache, you will need WPGraphQL v1.12.0 or newer.
